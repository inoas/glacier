## 0.3.1

- Fix Changelog.

## 0.3.0

- Fix detection of unqualified imports.
- Fix detection of aliased imports.
- Fix detection of renames.
- Files with white spaces are now ignored.
- Improved readme.
- Force rebased on `lpil/gleeunit` to keep all contributor history alive.
  - This was required because initially `Glacier` was supposed to depend on
    a patched `Gleeunit`, but the idea of patching `Gleeunit` a bit was
    rejected by the `Gleeunit` team. While this may not be strictly necessary
    this honors previous contributions transparently.
  - This was a quick and dirty process where I saved a lot of time by _not_
    fixing any merges and instead just adding them without touching them
    including the diff noise. As a consequence single commits if checked out
    might not run any more. After the dirty rebase I've commited the
    source code state equvialent to `0.2.7` to restore functionality.
- Proper BE noun instead of an AE one for the `LICENCE` file and naming.

## 0.2.7

- Fix `MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected` (#4).
- Cleanup `README.md`.

## 0.2.6

- Instruct to use `gleam add glacier --dev` to add as a dev dependency, only.

## 0.2.5

- Readme: Explain that `gleeunit` is optional if `glacier` is installed if `gleeunit/should` is replaced by `glacier/should`.

## 0.2.4

- More compatibility changes to run `glacier` alongside `gleeunit`:
  Added `glacier/should` which is a renamed `gleeunit/should`.

## 0.2.3

- Remove code that did nothing.

## 0.2.2

- Fixed `README.md`.

## 0.2.1

- Fixed `README.md`.

## 0.2.0

- Added `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Renamed internal gleeunit fork to gleeunit2 to avoid collisions.
- JavaScript: File renames are picked up by the watcher.
- Replaced `glacier.run()` with `glacier.main()` as latter did not make sense before.
- Fixed `README.md`.
- Fixed the logo to work across hexpm and github and shields badges.
